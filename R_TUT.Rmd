# 3.2 
# do cars with large engines use more fuel than cars with small engines?
# what does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like?
# use mpg: a data frame containing observations collected by USEPA on cars
mpg
```
image of the mpg data frame
```{r}
# plot of the mpg data using ggplot2
# displ, a car's engine size, is on the x-axis
# hwy, a car's highway efficiency, on the y-axis
#geom_point() adds a 'layer' to this graph and makes it a scattor plot
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
--plot of the data from 'mpg' , plotting a car's engine sie on the x-axis, against its highway efficiency on the y-axis
--looks like cars with largeer engines use more feul (duh)
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +

# 3.3 Aesthetic Mappings 
# adding a 3rd var to a 2D scatter by adding a visual proerty to an object in your plot
# reproduction of the above plot with class added as a color
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```
```{r}
#class is an unordered var, so it may not be optimal to map it using size
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

```{r}
# alpha is transparency
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))

# shape has six shapes used
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```
r rules
```{r}
# the aesthetic properties may be manually set
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "pink")
```
```{r}
# the aesthetic properties may be manually set
#
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty))
```
These plots set a continuous variable (city mileage) to different aedthetic markers
```{r}
# 3.5 Facets
# another method for multi variable data plotting
# var to facet wrap should be discrete

#example of 1 variable faceting
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow = 2)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(.~class)
```
A plot of highway mileage against display, faceted by class of vehicle, one variable
```{r}
# example of 2-var faceting
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv~class)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv~cyl)

```
Plot of data faceted on two variables
```{r}
# 3.6 Geometric Objects
# a 'geom' is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# these on the same plot
#note: pass the mappings to the ggplot function to avoid duplication errors

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```
different geometric representations of the same data
```{r}
#different aesthetics can be displayed in different layers
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth()
```
same plot as fig 14.c , with the scatter plot colored by class
```{r}
# local data arguments will override globals 
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"), se = FALSE)
```
Same plot as fig 15 with line filtered to include only class subcompact
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

# Statistical Transforms
#bar charts, histograms, frequency polygons bin and count data
#smoothers fit a model to your data, plot predictions come from this model 
# box plots compute a summary of the distribution of the data

#stat_plot can be used instead of geom_bar here
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```
chart of diamond count by cut quality
```{r}
# use geom_bar to override the default stat

  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median

fig a :plotted against frequency, not simply count
fig b: statistics summary of cut against depth
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) +

Colored Graphs,introduces a new var, organized by position adjustment
```{r}
# jitter to view all data points with a small amount of noise, as view all of them
#some will be obscured
